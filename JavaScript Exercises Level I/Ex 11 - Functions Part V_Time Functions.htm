		<h1>Javascript Exercise 11 - Using the Date & Time Functions</h1>
		<h2>Understanding Date</h2>
		<p> Date and Time manipulation are an essential part of JavaScript programming because they make 
			it possible for Web applications to mark the passage of time. The <code>Date</code> data type includes
			both date and time values. Because dates and times come in great variety the Date object
			type includes many methods.</p> 
		<p> In the example below we'll see how we can use some of these.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>Using the Date object and it's methods write the current time and date in different formats.
		</p>
		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<script>
			// Constructor without input value gets the current date and time
			var today = new Date();
			document.write("<p>Full Date/Time: " + today.toLocaleString() + "</br>");
			document.write("Full Date: " + today.toLocaleDateString() + "</br>");
			document.write("Full Time: " + today.toLocaleTimeString() + "</br>");
			document.write("Date Only: " + today.toDateString() + "</br>");
			document.write("Time Only: " + today.toTimeString() + "</p>");
		
			/* Custom Date and time - We need to add 1 because some methods start from 0
			* to obtain proper date and time
			*/
			document.write("<p>Custom Date (m/d/y): " + (today.getMonth() + 1) + "/" +
												today.getDate() + "/" +
												today.getFullYear() + "</br>");
			document.write("Custom Time (h:m:s:ms): " + today.getHours() + ":" +
												 today.getMinutes() + ":" +
												today.getSeconds() + "." +
												today.getMilliseconds() + "</p>");
