		<h1>Javascript Exercise 12 - Doing more with Date & Time Functions</h1>
		<h2>Computing Differences between Time</h2>
		<p>The <code>Date</code> object provides the programmer several methods that can be stringed 
			together and provide custom time output. Because some of therse values are <code>Number</code>
			 types, we also have access to all of the <code>Number</code> properties and methods when 
			 manipulating time output in our applications.</p> 
		<p> All this methods and tools make it possible to build apps that view the passage of time in many 
			different ways. A simple example of this can be seen in the exercise below:</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>Compute the difference in time between a future date and now.
		</p>
		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<script>
			var timeNow = new Date();
			var theFutureTime = new Date("9/9/2029");
			// The time below in minutes must be formatted in (h:m:s)
			var minutes = (theFutureTime - timeNow) / 60000;
			var days = minutes / 1440; // There are 1440 minutes in a day
			var years = days / 365; // 365 days in a year not counting lap years
			var yearPart = Math.floor(years);
			var monthPart = Math.floor((years - yearPart) * 12);
			var daysPart = Math.floor(((years - yearPart) * 12 - (monthPart)) * 30);
			document.write("The second coming will be in " + theFutureTime + " !!!? <br/>");
			document.write("Until then Time Remaining: " + minutes.toFixed(4) + " minutes<br/>");
			document.write("Or if you prefer in days...Time remaining: " + days.toFixed(4) + " days<br/>");
			document.write("Or in years ...Time remaining: " + years.toFixed(4) + " years<br/>");
			document.write("Or more clearly ... Time Remaining: " + yearPart + " years " + monthPart +
							" months " + daysPart + " days<br/>");
			document.write("Pray to God and Regret!</br>");
