	    <h1>JavaScript Exercise 2 - Writing Content in Document</h1>
	    We can use the <code>Document.write</code> function to output text from JavaScript, but this method
	    is most often used for testing purposes. However in a real Web app it's more common to use the 'innerHTML' property of 
	    the Document element. For testing and experimenting we can also use <code>console.log()</code> method
	    that outputs text in the browser console.

	    <h2>Problem</h2>
	    Write the message 'Hello, World!' on the browser with two methods.
	    <h2>Solution</h2>
		<h4>Writing 'Hello World!' in document body with 'document.write'</h4>
		<script>
		    // In HTML5 we do not need to quote language="Javascript" in scripts anymore
			document.write("Hello World!");
		</script>
		<h4>Writing 'Hello World!' in document body with 'innerHTML' property</h4>
		<div id="section"> </div>
		<script>
			var content = document.getElementById("section");
			content.innerHTML = "Hello World!";
		</script>
		
	</body>
</html>
