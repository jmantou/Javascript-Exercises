		<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
		<p>This is a Javascript simple app that after taking the weight and height as input from the user,
			computes the DMS of this person and categorizes the individual.</p> 
		<p>The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize the student with if ... else statement.
			In this level of exercises the app is not sanitizing the input from the user. This will be done in a later revision 
			of the app in Level II of JavaScript exercises.</p>
