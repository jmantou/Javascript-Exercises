		<h1>Javascript Exercise 9 - Building Custom Functions</h1>
		<h2>Disclaimer - Reducing Repetitive work by the use of Custom Functions</h2>
		<p>Generally, in every computer programming language, functions are used to reduce the work the programmer must perform
			when creating an application.</p>
		<p>Functions help us reduce programming workload in the following ways:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Reusing the Code</strong>. By encapsulating a simple task in a function, we can reuse it as 
		  	often as we want or need.</li>
		<li><strong>Ease of Understanding.</strong> Using functions helps the programmer reduce the complexity
			of the programming tasks.</li>
		<li><strong>Error and Bug Fixing.</strong> It is usually easier to trap bugs and errors when the program is 
			correctly compartmentalized with functions.</li>
		<li><strong>Ease of Coding Changes.</strong> We can make changes in various places in the program by changing the 
			function in only one place.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>We will start with a simple function that takes one argument, which is a number and returns
		the factorial of this number.</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>Write a finction that takes a number as an argument and returns the factorial of this number.
		</p>
		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<script>
			function computeFact(num)
			{
				if ((num === 0) || (num === 1))
					return 1;
				else
				{
					var fact = 1;
					for(var i = 1; i <= num; i++)
						var parag = (i - 1) * i;
						fact = fact * parag;
				}
				return fact;
			}
			
			const NUMBER_TO_COMPUTE_FACT = 5;
			document.write("<h3>Factorial of " + NUMBER_TO_COMPUTE_FACT + " = " + computeFact(5) +  "</h3>");
